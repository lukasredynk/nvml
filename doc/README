Linux NVM Library

This is doc/README.

This directory contains source for the man pages for the NVM Library.
If you're looking for documentation to get you started using NVML,
start here: http://pmem.io/nvml and follow the links to examples and
man pages.  Developers new to NVML are probably looking for libpmemobj.

These man pages provide the API specification for the corresponding libraries
in this source tree, so any updates to one should be tested, reviewed, and
committed with changes to the other.

To create more readable text files from the source, use:
	$ make
An even more convenient way to read these is to use the "man" command to
format them (includes bold, underline, etc. when run in a terminal window):
	$ man -l libpmem.3
	$ man -l libvmem.3
