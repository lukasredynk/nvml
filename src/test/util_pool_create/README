This is src/test/util_pool_create/README.

This directory contains a unit test for util_pool_create().

The program in util_pool_create.c takes a minimal pool size along with the
list of len:path pairs.
For example:

	./util_pool_create minlen len1:path1

This will call util_pool_create() on path1 using len1 as pool size.

minlen and len are interpreted as a decimal values unless they start with 0x.

If len is zero, the file pointed by path must exist.  Otherwise, the file is
created.
