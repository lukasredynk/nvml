Linux NVM Library

This is src/test/vmem_fork/README.


This directory contains a unit test for vmem_fork().

The program in vmem_fork.c takes a flag (0 or 1) argument
to use custom allocators, and an optional directory path where the pools can be
created.

WARNING: The process fork support in VMEM is limited.

If a pool is created after a fork call then both processes can continue
normally, but if the pool was created before the fork call,
then only the parent process can operate on the pool and the allocated memory.

If the parent process does not modify the memory in common pool, then the child
process can read from common pool safely. If any of the processes modify
the memory of the common pool, reads made by the other process result
in undefined behavior.
